## Solving the game of Snake with [Genetic Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_algorithm)

Original project by [Peter Binggeser](https://github.com/pbinggeser) didn't have much documentation or comments. I am taking this opportunity to take this repo as a self-learning platform where i will explore the following

- [x] [Github pages](https://pages.github.com/)
- [x] Redux
- [ ] FPS counter
- [ ] Responive web (Material-Ui/Bootstrap)
- [ ] Machine learning - This project uses [neataptic](https://github.com/wagenaartje/neataptic)
- [ ] Demystify the actual neural networks (NN)
- [ ] More coming... 
## To do

* Visualizing the NN - Clicking on snake grid to display the currently mutated form on the NN 
* Persisting snakes' "brain" into local storage 
* Suggesting to user to reload the "brain"
